### 🔢 3. Data Types Tasks
**File:** `data_types.py`  
Collection of small exercises related to:
- Working with integers
- Floating-point numbers
- Strings
- Formatting output

### ✖️ 4. Multiplication Sign
**File:** `multiplication_sign.py`  
Determines whether the product of three numbers is:
- Positive
- Negative
- Zero  

The solution avoids direct multiplication by analyzing the count of negative numbers.
